**Experiment No.: 3**  
**Date:** 16.08.2025  
**Register Number:** 212222060073  

---

## **Aim**
To demonstrate four prompt engineering types—**Straightforward Prompts, Tabular Format Prompting, Preceding Question Prompting, and Missing Word Prompting**—for a chosen use case from *Modulation Techniques for Multimedia Signals*, and evaluate them using Tabular Format Prompting.

---

## **Use Cases for All Prompt Types**
1. **Straightforward Prompts**  
   Useful for quick revision of basic modulation concepts before an exam.

2. **Tabular Format Prompting**  
   Best for structured comparison of AM, FM, and QPSK techniques.

3. **Preceding Question Prompting**  
   Helps in understanding *why* modulation is needed and *how* techniques like QPSK/FM solve communication problems.

4. **Missing Word Prompting**  
   Suitable for recall-based practice or fill-in-the-blank exam questions.

# **1. Straightforward Prompts**

### **Prompt 1:**  
Define modulation in one sentence.  
**Response:** Modulation is the process of varying a carrier signal to transmit information efficiently.

### **Prompt 2:**  
List three modulation techniques used in satellite communication.  
**Response:** Amplitude Modulation (AM), Frequency Modulation (FM), and Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK).

# **2. Tabular Format Prompting**

### **Prompt 1:**  
Provide a table comparing AM, FM, and QPSK in terms of signal quality, bandwidth, and application.

| Modulation | Signal Quality | Bandwidth Requirement | Application |
|-----------|----------------|------------------------|-------------|
| AM | Poor (noise sensitive) | Low | Voice transmission |
| FM | Good, less noise | Medium | Radio & TV broadcast |
| QPSK | High, robust | High | Digital TV, satellite multimedia |

### **Prompt 2:**  
Table showing advantages and disadvantages of QPSK.

| Advantages of QPSK | Disadvantages of QPSK |
|--------------------|------------------------|
| High spectral efficiency | Requires complex receiver |
| Better noise immunity | More prone to phase errors |
| Suitable for multimedia | Needs higher bandwidth |

---

# **3. Preceding Question Prompting**

### **Prompt 1:**  
Why is modulation necessary in satellite communication? How does QPSK help?

**Response:**  
- Modulation enables long-distance transmission, reduces interference, and uses bandwidth efficiently.  
- QPSK transmits 2 bits per symbol, improving data rate and reliability for multimedia.

### **Prompt 2:**  
How does FM provide better quality than AM?

**Response:**  
- FM is less sensitive to amplitude noise.  
- Ensures better audio/video quality in satellite systems.

# **4. Missing Word Prompting**

### **Prompt 1:**  
“In satellite communication, modulation is used to improve ____.”  
**Response:** Transmission efficiency.

### **Prompt 2:**  
“QPSK modulation encodes ____ bits per symbol.”  
**Response:** 2 bits.

# **Evaluation & Conclusion**

| Prompt Type | Use Case Scenario | Strengths | Limitations | Result |
|-------------|-------------------|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Straightforward Prompt | Quick revision before exam | Simple, fast recall | Lacks details | Best for memory refresh |
| Tabular Format Prompt | Compare AM, FM, QPSK | Structured, clear | Needs prior understanding | Best for detailed comparison |
| Preceding Question Prompt | Understanding "why" & "how" | Encourages reasoning | Can be lengthy | Best for conceptual clarity |
| Missing Word Prompt | Exam recall practice | Good for assessment | Limited depth | Best for quick recall |

---

### **Result:**  
All four prompt types were executed successfully.
